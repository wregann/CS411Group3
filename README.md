Project Proposal 1: My Day at BU
---
This web application will assist students that attend BU in keeping track of buses, dining hall menus, and classes. The user will input their schedule, where they generally live, and potential food preferences, and our app will save that information in a database and recommend places to eat, bus routes, and events that match their schedule. Furthermore, our database will store the current menus and all the bus routes available. We will use Boston University API’s (https://webapi.bu.edu/services/) such as the dining hall menu api and bus route api. We plan to either use Google or Kerberos as our third party login.

Project Proposal 2: 
---
This web application will create a music playlist according to current weather and the user’s play history. This playlist will be based on their favorite genres and they will have an option to add music outside of their main interests (like from new releases or whats popular). We will use the Spotify Api to get the users songs and genres, and we will use openweather to get the current weather in the users area. Our database will store the users favorite kind of music, past weather playlists, potentially some of their liked songs, and how the user felt the playlist did at catching the feel of the weather. We will use Spotify as our third party authentication.
