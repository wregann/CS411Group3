# Tech Stack Explanation / Justification
Our team used a vite/vue frontend, a flask backend, and an Amazon RDS MySQL server. We chose all of these tools for convenience's sake and not for any performance reasons.
The vite/vue frontend was chosen as many sources claimed it as an easier frontend to learn than Angular.
Some of us have python experience but none of us have PHP experience, so we were definitely choosing a python backend. Sources said flask was easier than django, so we chose flask.
We chose a MySQL server as our information makes sense in a tabulated, relational form. 
We chose to host this server on Amazon RDS so each of us could easily access the server when working on the project (and so the graders could easily test it too). Also, it was free.
