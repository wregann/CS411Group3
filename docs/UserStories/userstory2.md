# User Story 2: New Genre Playlist w/ Weather
## == New Genre Barbecue ==
It's a beautiful sunny summer weekend in southern US, and the user is having a picnic/barbecue with friends. The user wants to make a playlist to match the weather, but his friends want to explore the genre of spunky indie-rock, but their liked songs only contain country music. He wants to use our web app to make a playlist that matches the mood and has a specific genre.

Assuming that the user is logged in already to the API the user can create a new playlist by selecting popular songs that fit the indie-rock genre and build up from there with the mood preference.
