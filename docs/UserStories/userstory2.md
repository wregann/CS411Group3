# User Story 2: New Genre Playlist w/ Weather
## == New Genre Barbecue ==
It's a beautiful sunny summer weekend in southern US, and the user is having a picnic/barbecue with friends. The user wants to make a playlist to match the weather, but his friends want to explore the genre of spunky indie-rock, but their liked songs only contain country music. He wants to use our web app to make a playlist that matches the mood and has a specific genre.

## Technical
The user would be able to log in to their Spotify account using the API if they weren't already. If the authentication of their username and password is correct, the home page of the app will have the essential feature "make playlist" in the center, where the log-in user will have permission to create a new playlist. There are a couple of options to choose from when user making the playlist. To apply the preference of a specific genre, the user can click the checkbox of "genre" under the options of making a new playlist. A list of different genres will show under the "genre" option, and the user can create a new playlist with indie-rock popular songs by selecting the "indie-rock" genre.
