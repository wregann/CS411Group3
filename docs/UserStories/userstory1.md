# User Story 1: Making Playlist to Match Weather
## == Plans Cancelled ==
User is a young college student that was excited to have a fun day outside in the sun with friends. Last minute, a storm comes in and cancels their plans. The user wants to create a playlist with sad chill music to match their mood for the rest of the day.

The user would be able to login to their Spotify account using the API, if they weren't already. If the authentication of their username and password is correct â€“ they will have permission to create a new playlist, and apply their weather preference accordingly to fit the mood desired.
