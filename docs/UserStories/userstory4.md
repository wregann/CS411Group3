## == Gameday ==
It's gameday, and the football team is on the bus going to the rival schools homecoming game. Everyone is amped and excited for the match, classic 
Friday Night Lights setting. The equipment manager needs to make a hyped playlist and wants to use the webapp to generate a collection of songs to put them in the right headspace to go stomp out the other team on the cool fall night.
