# User Story 4: New Playlist with Modifiers
## == Gameday ==
It's gameday, and the football team is on the bus going to the rival schools homecoming game. Everyone is amped and excited for the match, classic 
Friday Night Lights setting. The equipment manager needs to make a hyped playlist and wants to use the webapp to generate a collection of songs to put them in the right headspace to go stomp out the other team on the sunny fall afternoon.

## Technical
This user doesn't just need happy music, they need the highest energy music. This requires a special modifier. After this user logs in with spotify and inputs the closest city to them, they see the Make Custom Playlist checkbox. They click this checkbox and a few options below it appear. They see hte option to specify if the playlist should be high energy, non-lyrical, have high danceability, etc. They pick the high energy option that is made for such occasions as this. They select the date for the game and then click the make playlist button. After a little while, a playlist is made for them and a prompt appears showing them that it was successfully made.
